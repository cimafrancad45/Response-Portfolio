        Hello, my name is Daryl Cimafranca and I would like to welcome you to my portfolio page! I am a gigantic nerd who loves to play videogames, watch anime, and just chill in general.
        <br> 
        <br>
        I am a very enthusiastic person who is willing to learn new things.
        I'm highly adaptable and a very easy person to work with. I can say these things safely because I'm team player in the multiplayer games I play like
        Final Fantasy XIV: Online, PUBG, League of Legends, and Overwatch.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm also a very avid fighting game fan. I love playing Dragon Ball Fighterz, Tekken 7, Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition and Ultra Street Fighter IV.
        My favorite professional fighting game players are Daigo Umehara, Tokido, GO1, Infiltration, Filipino Champ, Justin Wong, and Momochi.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another unimportant tidbit about me is that I'm a big Vocaloid fan. (My profile picture was when I was in Japan for a Vocaloid concert.) I really admire the creative community for it. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Well, that's enough about me, I hope you like what you see!
